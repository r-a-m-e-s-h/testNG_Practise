	TestNG - Next Generation
	
	Selenium - WebApplication automation framework
	
	TestNg is Testing framework , can be used for unit, integration, functional, end to end Testing
	
	Selenium, java, TestNg is a combination 
	
	only with java we can't do automation Testing , so we need selenium framework
	
	Likewise TestNg helps to overcome the real time issues. and it have built in functions.
	
	Download TestNG from eclipse-> help-> Eclipse market place ->search testng and download it.
	
	Add testng to the project rightclick on project -> bulid path -> configure build path -> add library -> select testng ->finish -> apply & close
	
	// Topic-1 ( @Test )  
	
	we can run the class by using @test testng annotation without using the java main method.
	
	for @test we need to import this package ->org.testng.annotation.test
	
	we can run all the testcases at singleshot by using testng testng.xml file.
	
	// Topic-2 ( Priority )
	
	* if we don't set the priority then the test case will be executed on alphabetical order only
	
	* priority is a keyword , not an annotation.
	
	* priority help us to make the testcase which need to run 1st.
	
	* Default priority for the test case is 0.
	
	* priority support for negative numbers also like -1,-2,-3(here -3 is the 1st priority).
	
	* priority accepts only integer value only.
	
	// Topic-3 ( enable )
	
	* if we want to skip a testcase , then we use enable keyword.
	
	* Enable is a boolean type.
	
	* by Default enable value is true.
	
	* set -> @Test(enable = false) to fail a testcase
	
	* we can use both priority and enable with @Test annotation
	
	//Topic-4 ( Dependency )
	
	* suppose if u have to run 100 testcases at a time but the important key feature method is failing and the application depends on it only 
	
	* for the abobe scenario we need that DependsonMethod
	
	* @Test(dependsOnMethod="highSchool")
	
	* mostly the sub methods depends on the main method only if the main method fail but sub method works , so no use in it
	
	* so we go with DependsOnMethod only 
	
	* for eg: amazon login site is not working but the inner feature working so there is no use in it
